**Purpose:: 	To provide an easy frame work to both simulate most solid-state NMR
experiments AND as an aid in the development of new experiments
Several features have been added to facilitate the later.  Any detection
operator can be specified, any initial density operator, 'ficticious' phase cycleing, 
multiple acqusiation during a single pulse sequence.  

	It was designed in a module nature.  The main interfaces and drivers can act
as a good starting point for designing more complicated ideas.  i.e. it was made to be added
on to.  As of right now it is a text file driven program (i.e. command line)


**current release is 'solid-2.0'

**contained in this release::
	1) dependance on 'BlochLib' is explicit (and is why this is incuded as a 'examples' of 'blochlib')
	2) a simple spin system generator and spin tensor generator
	3) various interfacing elements to simulate various types of solid state experiments
	4) a minor MPI upgrade that allows the parallelization of the powder loops 

**compilation:
	--It compiles quite well on any system with gcc 2.95.3 (or greater) strict 
	ANSI compilence is followed at all times...simply follow these simple steps
	
		./configure --prefix=<your install dir> --with-blochlib=<dir of blochlib>
		make
		make install
	
	--TO compile with MPI you need to compile BlochLib with the '--with-mpi' option
	AND you need to turn on this options as well
		./configure --prefix=<your install dir> --with-blochlib=<dir of blochlib> --with-mpi=<mpi directory>
		make
		make install
	
	--Two things should now be made
