

These files conatin the permutations

these permutations are hard to calculate for
large sets simply beecuase there could be many cuplicates
and we also know that 'mirrors' are to be ommited

the nameing structure is as follows

pCy_<number distinct objected>x<total length of the permutation string>.bn

for example
pCy_4x8.bn

contains all the unique and non-mirrored permutations like
	
	0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 
	0 0 1 1 2 3 2 3
	...
	3 2 1 0 0 1 2 3
	
there are 4 distinct elements in an 8 length permuation string
