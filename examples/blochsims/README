BlochSim Examples

--Found here are a variety of examples to show you several simple and complex
  simulations and programs using the 'Bloch/Classical' part of BlochLib
  
  
 --blochsims/simple90/ --> as expected...performs a simple N degree pulse
                           on a 'grid' of dipole-dipole spinns...hmmmm i wonder what 
                           a cube of spins does (see papers by 'Jeener' to figure that out)
 
 --blochsims/relaxcoord/ --> demonstration of an off axis relaction
 
 --blochsims/bulksus/ -->the effect of the nulk suseptibility as a function of the 'D' parameter
 
                           
 --blochsims/mas/ --> a 'spinning' grid example...here we revolve a grid of dipole-dipole
                      spins around the magic angle...such lovely strange behavior
                      ...i believe i will find more...

 --blochsims/EPI/ --> performs an EPI (echo planar Imaging) simulation on a grid
                      of spins
                      
 --blochsims/echo/ --> performs an echo experment under the presence of gradients...
 
 --blochsims/crazed/ --> attempts to simulate a CRAZED (see Warren Warren papers)
                         experiment on a grid of spins

 --blochsims/magfields/ --> generic magnetic field calulators, fitters, etc..
                            these programs can get large, but do so much
                            from rotating calulated 'real' fields over a
                            large array of spin, to fitting fields to match
                            certain criteria, to coil design simulations
                            the config files are large, the number of parameters
                            is even larger, multi grids an multi coils are used
                            throughout...interesting experiments about eo be performed i say
                        
 --blochsims/yylin/ --> attempt to match the dynamics of the YY Lin 'NMR Chaos'
                        found when Radiation Damping and the Demagnitizaing Field
                        are allowed to weild nasty non-linearity on the system
