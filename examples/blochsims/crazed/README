Crazed README

**crazed.cc, crazed.h, crazed2.cc
this program is a bit strange...sue to 'overloading' of the compiler's memory
abilities, (basically compiler craps out when trying to perform -O2 or -O3 optimizations)

the -O2, and -O3 optimization provide a dramatic speed enhancemnet, so
i tries breaking the code up into 2 separate files...sadly this did not solve
the problem...

it seesm the most difficult part to compile is the ODE solver
and the 'function' from the 'bloch' class...2 things
that cannot be separated into separate files...

soo compilation of this set of files will fail...however, the code is good,
and may serve as a good example

the root of the problem comes from adding the  'GradientGrid' layer to 
both 'ListBlochParams' and 'Offset' classes...(a nessesary operation
to include Gradients in pulse sequences)...depending on the number of pulses in the
sequence and the number of 'BlochSolver.solve()' function called, the 
template unrolling becomes too memory intensive and the compiler barfs

a possible solution may be to separate the 'BlochSolver.solve()' function
calls into separate files..however, becuase the solvers rely heaviliy on
the all the parameter set up variables..the functionalizing may require another
class construction to act as an interface to the 'BlochSolver'

the design of such an interface has not yet been sovled as 'BlochSolver was 
designed to be the main interface between the ode solver and parameters 
as well as the output and data collector...i still ponder this...


**crazed_1.cc
this file will compile using 

blcc -n -O -finline-function -funroll-loops crazed_1.cc

and is the consolidation of the above files into one file...
