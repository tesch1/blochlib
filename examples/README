BlochLib Examples

--Found here are a variety of examples designed to show you both examples of
  specific classes, some are quite simple, others a bit more complex
  
 
 --blochsims/ --> simulations or programs that use the Classical drivers from the lib
              --> Magnetic Field Calculations are also in here

 --classes/   -->Here are the generic 'background' class demonstrations
 --data_readers/  --> VNMR (Varian) binary (1D or 2D data), SpinSight 1D binary, a matlab binary 
 --diffusion/ --> a simple 1D diffusion example

 --minuit/ --> very simple examples on how to use the MINUIT minimizer in both
 		interactive and functional modes
 --mpiplay/ --> testing and demonstrations of the MPI functionality
 
 --qmsims/ --> simulations or programs that use the Quantum Mechanincal drivers from the lib

 --solid-1.6/ --> a LARGE solid-state simulation package that allows for easy propogation
                and fid generation of most all solid state sequences (it is a rival to SIMPSON)
                this package has its own chunk of documentation and syntax
                there is a 'configure' file for this package
                also included here is 'Scripto' a VERY simple scripting language to used
                as the input file generators for 'solid' it is written for parrellel integration
                of powder angles using MPI
