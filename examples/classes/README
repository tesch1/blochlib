BlochLib Examples

--Found here are a variety of examples designed to show you both examples of
  specific classes, some are quite simple, others a bit more complex
  
  
 --exmaples/
   -Here are the generic 'background' class demonstrations

  
  --vec_examples.cc--> several Vector operations demonstrated
  
  --mat_examples.cc--> matrix utilization example (PLEASE READ THE MATRIX SECTION IN 'doc/')
  
  --grid_examples.cc--> an example of using Grids classes
  
  --shape_examples.cc--> the XYZshape object and its various creation parts
  
  --ode_example.cc--> using the Differential Equation solver
  
  --gradfunc_example.cc --> Using the "GradientFunction" Alteration generator on 'ListBlochParams'
  
  --fftw_examples.cc --> tests the FFTW library..it will fail without that Lib
      NOTE:: the matlab file 'makemesh.m' is used to plot the resulting data
 
  --stencil_vector_test.cc --> tests the finite difference operations on vector
                               (things like Derivates, and such)
                               these should be quite fast and implimented well
                               

  --stencil_prep_test.cc --> this designed to test the various aspects
                              of the Stencils part of the lib
                              the 'Prep' stage, the implimentation
                              of finite difference Stencil operations (Lapacians,
                              Gradients, etc),Edge/Face Detection, and finally
                              simple implimentation of 'BoundaryConditions'
                              on GRIDs and the 'SHAPES' (i.e. 3D objects)...
                              NOTE:: some of these things are still in the 
                              devel/experimental stage, and thus could crash,
                              or (even worse) produce wrong results use with caution
